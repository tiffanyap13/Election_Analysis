 ## Challenge Overview
 The challenge required me to pull the csv file into Visual Studio and use the data to run the analysis. Various code was used to calculate the county results, the candidates' results and to determine the respective winners. ![Results](Challenge/Election_Results/Terminal.pg)  I also wrote the results to a text file which resulted in the following: ![Results Text File](Challenge/txt_file_restults.png).
